# InheritedWidget demo

 A clear example of how to use InheritedWidget to "lift" state in Flutter

 If you're not familiar with Flutter, it can be run simply by creating a new flutter project and replacing the lib directory

 ```flutter create <inheritedwidget_demo>```

 Also you can run without a device using flutter web if your --enable-web setting is true

 ```flutter run -d chrome```
